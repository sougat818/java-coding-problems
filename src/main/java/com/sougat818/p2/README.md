# Problem 2

[LeetCode - Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum)

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

```

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

```

### Daily Coding Problem #1

Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.

For example, given ```[10, 15, 3, 7]``` and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.

Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?
